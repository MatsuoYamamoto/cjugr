## CJUG SDTM+R Team March 2016 Meeting log

### Objective

In previous meeting, we began reading an example trial data created in CJUG into R with R AnalyticFlow Software.
Our current goal is to generated a part of SDTM dataset using R. 

### Tools

We are using [R AnalyticFlow](http://www.ef-prime.com/products/ranalyticflow_en/index.html).

### Progress

For this example data,first we are trying to generate a 
part of QS domain dataset, including USUBJID, QSORRESS, QSTEST, and QSTESTCD.

In the meeting, we achieved to extract a raw data containing information to build USUBJID, QSDTC, and QSORRES.

Current workflow file can be found [here](Example2.rflow).
